When the player starts a new game, there should be some amount that the player starts with. 

Before the start of each hand, the player should be asked an amount to bet.
This amount should not be 0 and should not be more than what the player has. 

The bet amount should be added or subtracted from the total depending on if the player won or lost. 

When the player has no more money, he should not be allowed to play another hand.
