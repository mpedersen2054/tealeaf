Classes
=======
- a class should do the smallest possible useful thing; should have single responsibility

= example = bycicles =
- when in lower gear, you can pedal many times to make the tire rotate just once
- when in higher gear, you can pedal once to make the tire go around once
- to represent this:
	
	chainring = 52      # the number of 'teeth'
	cog = 11
	ratio = chainring / cog.to_f
	ratio = 4.73
	- so the tire rotates almost 5 times for each revolution of petal

	chainring = 30
	cog = 27
	ratio = chainring / cog.to_f
	ratio = 1.11
	- so the tire rotates about 1 time for each revolution of petal

= end example =

- make sure a class a only a single responsibility
